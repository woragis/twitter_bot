The main purpose of this account is to be focused on posting fun stuff and memes about gaming, anime and culture. As a programmer this is a project to show my abilities and ideas to the world. This project will help me get a tech job in the future and I would love to be productive to the twitter community as a social media page to help others see interesting stuff throughout their day.
